<h1>Nycaabs</h1>

<h3>(NYC Address and BIN Search)</h3>

**Nycaabs** searches New York City's open data sources for building information, by address or BIN (building identification number).

This project aims to help maintain NYC's OpenStreetMap data, in particular building footprints, heights, BINs, and addresses.

The Github main branch is hosted at https://jmapb.github.io/nycaabs/. Nycaabs can also self-hosted or downloaded and used locally.
